The main file in this homework is search.py with the implementation of the graphSearch function on line 75.	

The problem for this homework was to implement graph search that could be used for Breath First Search, Depth First Search, and Uniform Cost Search depending on what data type the function was passed.

One of the tasks was to create our own game state structure that we could pass around the path history to return at the end.
